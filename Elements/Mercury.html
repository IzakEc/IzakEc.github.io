 along with Bromine (BR). Mercury at room temperature is a fast moving, shiny but very poisonous to humans.(Hg) stands for hydrargyrum which originated from Greek which meant "liquid Sliver”. Although very poisonous to humans, Mercury can still be very helpful because of its electro-magnetic properties for example: it could be used in switches in thermostats, coolant in nuclear power plants and neon light. sometimes, when mercury was mined is would surround gold like a shiny pellet would have to burn to get the purified gold.
