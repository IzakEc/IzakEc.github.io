             <h2>Symbol And Atomic Number</h2>
             <p><strong> Gold is a chemical element with the symbol Au (from Latin: aurum) atomic number 79, making it one of the higher atomic number elements that naturally occur. In its purest form, it is a bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, and ductile metal.</strong></p>

             <h2>Properties</h2>
             <p><strong>1.Gold is a soft metal with a number of interesting physical properties. Gold is both malleable and ductile. Gold is a heavy metal and one gram of gold can be hammered out into a thin sheet of gold a metre in area, and just 230  so thick. Gold leaf is translucent and the transmitted light is greenish blue.</strong></p>
             <p><strong>2.The Physical properties of Gold are the characteristics that can be observed without changing the substance into another substance. Physical properties are usually those that can be observed using our senses such as color, luster, freezing point, boiling point, melting point, density, hardness and odor.</strong></p>
             <p><strong>3.They are the characteristics that determine how it will react with other substances or change from one substance to another. Chemical properties are only observable during a chemical reaction.  Substances may be brought about by changes brought about by burning, rusting, heating, exploding.</strong></p>
             <h2>The Boiling Point</h2>
             <p><strong>The boiling point of gold is 2,700C.</p></strong>
