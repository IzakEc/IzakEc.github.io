<h2>basic information about the element Arsenic </h2>
<p>The element that I am going to use from the periodic table is Arsenic.The symbol is AS, and the atomic number is 33.
the property of Arsenic is solid, ordinary Arsenic is grey,<br>thou there are also yellow ones which is more toxic and poisonouse.</p>
<p>So how is yellow Arsenic made?<br> well regular Arsenic converts into Yellow Arsenic when put in light room temperature.<br>
when it's heated it smells like garlic,
it is highly dangerouse if you attempt to touch it, you can breath in the air which contains Arsenic dust it could lead to certain death.</p>
 <p>The boiling point of Arsenic is 613 degree c, and the melting point is 817 degre c.<br>Albertus Magnus found the element Arsenic 
in 1250 A.D WHERE WAS IT FOUND: information has not been found.</p>

<img src="https://image.shutterstock.com/image-photo/fresh-seafood-raw-shrimps-squids-260nw-1068231101.jpg"><br>
<p>There are some certain type of seaweed<br> that contains inorganic arsenic.</p>
<h3>difference between inorganic arsenic and organic arsenic.</h3>
<p>Inorganic arsenic is human made and naturally occuring, which could harm our health.</p>
<p>Organic arsenic is a form of a molecule and has at least one carbon atom.<br>
Arsenic can kill a person in two to four hours,although victims wre known to procrastinate it unill fornight.<br>
and for few the misery lasted 24 hours.<br>it is known that 77 million people died from arsenic in Bangladesh, which is<br>
