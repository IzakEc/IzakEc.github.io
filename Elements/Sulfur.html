              <p>Sulfur is an unscented and brittle solid element, it is insoluble in water and soluble in carbon disulifide. In every state wether solid, liquid or gas elementel sulfur occurs in more than one allotropic form or modification. Which means that it is solid element,unless it's melted, it'll turn into a red liquid.</p>

             <h2>Melting Points and Boiling Points,Metal Or Not?</h2>
             <p>Sulfurs boiling points are 444.6°C and its melting points are 115.2°C. And Sulfur is<strong> not</strong> a metal.</p>

             <h2>Who?When?And where was <strong>Sulfur</strong> dicovred?</h2>
             <p>The credit for dicovering the elemnt sulfur is given to Hennig Brand (1669),however it was recognised by Antoine Lavoiser 1777. But scholars say that there was no person responsible for discovering the element sulfur, because it was used in ancient times.
                Even though the use of the element sulfur was quite widespread among the alchemists since ancient times, it was in the year 1777,when Antoine Lavoiser, an investor and adminstraitor of a bank in France, convinced the world that the element sulfur is not a compound but an element. When Sulfur is burned, it melts down into a red liquid. 
                It's not surprising that the Romans and Greeks were so interested by sulfur.

                With the advent of industrial revolution, the demand for sulfur increased alot across the world , espescially in the european continent. This natraul element (sulfur) is found only in a few areas in the world.</p>
